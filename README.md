secretSanta
===========

soltuion we came up with at coding dojo(http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Developers-Berlin/events/159448622/)



It is Christmas time and you are part of the Secret Santa game. It is a tradition where one gives a gift anonymously to a randomly assigned person.

In this Coding Kata "Secret Santa" you create a small programm that assigns randomly each Coding Dojo participant as the giver of the gift to another one as the presentee.

Take care that the giver is not the same person as the presentee and that each person gets only one gift while each person gives only one gift.
